Salesforce Extensions for Visual Studio Code are a set of open-source extensions that come with rich tools for developing on the Salesforce platform. To make our extensions accessible across different machine specs and developer experiences, we offer two ways for you to leverage their power:
1. A desktop version of the extension pack that is available on the Visual Studio Code extensions marketplace. Requires downloading and installation of Visual Studio Code and the Salesforce extension pack.

2. Code Builder, a browser based development environment that is optimized for Salesforce and has everything you need to build applications on the platform without downloads and installations. It provides you the flexibility to work anywhere, from any computer, but with some limitations. Code Builder is currently in beta.

Both offer access to the rich tooling and unleash the power of Salesforce VS Code extensions. No matter whether you are using VS Code on desktop or Code Builder from a browser, the Salesforce extensions you access are the same. While the extensions generally function the same way regardless of how they are being accessed, there are some nuances to be aware of.
### When to Choose Code Builder
Code Builder is a browser-based development environment that comes preinstalled with tools you need for Salesforce development. Code Builder untethers you from a desktop and enables you to access your development environment from anywhere. We pre-configure your environment for you, so you cannot install additional extensions. Unlike working on a desktop where you save your files to a local machine, you must either deploy your changes to your org, or commit them to source control to save your work. Remember to do this before you close the Code Builder tab on your browser so you don’t lose your work. Code Builder is a good choice of development environment for you if: 

1. Your workplace imposes installation restrictions on your machine, and you are unable to install VS Code or VS Code extensions.
2. Your machine specifications or network latency limit you from installing VS Code on your desktop. 
3. You need quick access to only key Salesforce developer workflows.
4. You like the idea of accessing a development environment from anywhere, even though it might not give you access to some of the bells and whistles that you are used to accessing from your desktop. 

### When to Choose Salesforce Extensions for Desktop
VS Code Extensions installed on a desktop are a part of the rich experience that developers working in VS Code are used to. Use our extension pack with other favorite extensions. We [recommend](./apex/refactoring.md) some. Salesforce extensions for the desktop are the right choice for you if:

1. There are some VS Code extensions, in addition to the Salesforce Extensions pack that you absolutely cannot live without. 
2. You are a LWC developer and LWC mobile previews are a key part of your development work.
3. The usage limitations currently imposed on Code Builder (beta) are an issue for you.
 **Test and Update these** 
4. LWC Local Development TEST
5. You cannot live without your keyboard shortcuts.
6. Functions Dev. Is it same? TEST
7. Anything else?

### Important Considerations for Code Builder Beta
* We've capped usage for beta at 20 hours for a maximum of 30 days. 
* We highly recommend that you save your work and close the browser tab that is running Code Builder to stop the usage clock when you aren’t using Code Builder.
