Salesforce Extensions for Visual Studio Code are a set of open-source extensions that come with rich tools for developing on the Salesforce platform. To make our extensions accessible across different machine specs and developer experiences, we offer two ways for you to leverage the power of VS Code extensions:
1. A desktop version that is available as an extension on the Visual Studio Code extensions marketplace. Requires downloading  and installation of Visual Studio Code.
2. Code Builder, a browser based development environment that is optimized for Salesforce and has everything you need to build applications on the Platform without the hassle of downloads and installations. It provides all the goodness of the desktop experience, but provides you the flexibility to work anywhere, from any computer minus the hassle of installation. Code Builder is currently in beta.
Both offer access to the rich tooling and unleash the power of Salesforce VS Code extensions.  No matter whether you are using VS Code on desktop or Code Builder in the web, the extensions you access are the same!  While the extensions generally function the same way from either place, there are some nuances to be aware of.
## When to Choose Code Builder
Code Builder is a browser-based development environment that comes preinstalled with tools you need for Salesforce development. Code Builder untethers you from a desktop and enables you to access your development environment from anywhere. We pre-configure your environment for you, so you cannot install additional extensions. Unlike working on a desktop where you save your files to a local machine, you must either deploy your changes to your org, or commit them to source control to save your work.Remember to do this before you close the Code Builder tab on your browser so you don’t lose your work.

***Important Considerations for Code Builder Beta*** 
* We have capped usage for beta at 20 hours for a maximum of 30 days. 
* We highly recommend that you save your work and close the browser tab that is running Code Builder to stop the usage clock when you aren’t using Code Builder.


Code Builder is a good choice of development environment for you if: 

1. Your workplace imposes installation restrictions on your machine, and you are unable to install VS Code or VS Code extensions.
2. Your machine specifications or network latency limit you from installing VS Code on your desktop. 
3. You need quick access to only key Salesforce Developer workflows.
4. You like the idea of accessing a development environment that you can log into from anywhere, even though it might not give you access to all the features that you are used to accessing from your desktop. 

## When to Choose Salesforce Extensions for Desktop
1. You are a VS Code pro who is used to all the bells and whistles that VS Code Desktop and the VS Code Marketplace have to offer. There are some VS Code extensions that you absolutely cannot live without.
2. You are a LWC developer and LWC mobile previews are a key part of your development work.
3. The usage limitations currently imposed on Code Builder (beta) are an issue for you.
